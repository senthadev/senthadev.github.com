title: Finding forgotten documents in gmail
---

Our mail boxes are filled with hidden gems. It contains memories which are connected to certain messages.
I started to notice the forgotten gems while I was searching for old mails. The path I travelled, the hurdles I jumped, 
my thoughts and my ideas; its very interesting to go through these forgotten gems. I remembered an wise one said, "never forget the way you came". This is where I realized that my gmail had more than 10000 mails going back to start. Its all the way from time when gmail was introduced and I got an invite from a friend to join.

Lets say, I want to find all the images (jpg and png) I received, which are more than 1KB in size, before 2008.

So I used the following search string to achieve it :

    
    filename:jpg OR filename:png size:1000 before:2008/01/01 has:attachment

And got my result :)

Ohh, and I want to get all the pdf documents which I received between 2005-2006

    filename:pdf size:0 before:2006/01/01 after:2005/01/01 has:attachment

Good luck on hidden gem hunting.

(I guess free service provider is also doing the same to learn my behaviours and narrow the ads which are directly targeting me)
