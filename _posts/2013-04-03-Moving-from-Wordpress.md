title: Moving from Wordpress
---

Hello Guys,

Sometimes back, I was using wordpress.com [senthadev.wordpress.com](http://senthadev.wordpress.com) to host my blogs. 
But not satisfied with it. Have to pay more to include a simple javascript snippet. And it felt bulky. Now I have started to use
github/jekyll. And I love it. Power of simple.

Will be moving my old notes soon. And have to include disqus to handle comments/feedbacks for my notes.
