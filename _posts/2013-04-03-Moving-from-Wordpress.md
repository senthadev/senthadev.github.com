EDIT: Now Disqus is enabled for my notes.
I was going though my old notes, found this quote which I learned sometime ago.
    If you see something so beautiful, remember that there will be always
    an ugly site not visible, but its there!!

    "Someone's garbage is another one's treasure!!" , how can I fit this theory into a startup 

Hello Guys,

Sometimes back, I was using wordpress to host my blog. 
But not satisfied with it. Have to pay more to include a simple javascript snippet. And it felt bulky. Now I have started to use
github/jekyll. And I love it. Power of simple.

Will be moving my old notes soon. And have to include disqus to handle comments/feedbacks for my notes.
